title: Testing Filenames
layout: post

Jekyll's normal filename format for posts is `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`.
I created a couple of files in the `_posts` directory that don't fit this to see if Jekyll would render them.
One is date-only (`2024-10-09.md`), one is title-only (`short-title.md`).
Both have `title` and/or `date` fields in their front matter to specify the missing info.

Neither file is rendered.
The [GitHub build output](https://github.com/bluegraybox/test-blog/actions/runs/11254469539/job/31291954850) shows the other posts and pages being rendered, but doesn't give any warning messages for the files it doesn't render.
